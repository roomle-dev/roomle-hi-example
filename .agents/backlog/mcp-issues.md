These are issues in the MCP server, chat or planner detected by the MCP prompt tests.

Each issue names the problem, its cause, the to-do, the test of the fix and how to reproduce it; the
overview names the module, team or repository responsible for the fix, and the model and the
reasoning effort of the run that reproduces it — empty where it is unknown; a model the chat sends
no effort for runs at its provider's default. Library data issues are tracked in
[library-issues.md](library-issues.md). An issue leaves this document when its fix is in the code.
The guideline for every server issue is
[Guards Are a Last Resort](../../AGENTS.md#guards-are-a-last-resort): wrong content an agent creates
is an instruction problem first; correct where the intent is clear, report what was corrected, and
never drop the agent's content silently.

## Overview

| # | Issue | Kind | Responsible | Priority | Model | Reasoning effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

`run.json` and `planner-calls.json` of the run directories named under **Reproduce** hold the payload
the model sent; the directories are under `.temp/result/`.
