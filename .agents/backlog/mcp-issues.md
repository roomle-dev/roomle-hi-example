These are issues in the MCP server, chat or planner detected by the MCP prompt tests.

Each issue names the problem, its cause, the to-do, the test of the fix and how to reproduce it; the
overview names the module, team or repository responsible for the fix, and the model and the
reasoning effort of the run that reproduces it — empty where it is unknown; a model the chat sends
no effort for runs at its provider's default. Library data issues are tracked in
[library-issues.md](library-issues.md). A calculation error of the library is an MCP issue here
when an invalid attribute value the tools sent caused it, and a library issue there otherwise
(D99 of [roomle-ui `.agents/homag-intelligence/hi-tools-behaviour.md`](https://github.com/roomle-dev/roomle-ui/blob/master/.agents/homag-intelligence/hi-tools-behaviour.md#3-decisions)). An issue leaves
this document when its fix is in the code.
The guideline for every server issue is
[Guards Are a Last Resort](../../AGENTS.md#guards-are-a-last-resort): wrong content an agent creates
is an instruction problem first; correct where the intent is clear, report what was corrected, and
never drop the agent's content silently.

Keep this document, its guidance and its overview table when no issues are open, ready for new issues.

## Overview

| # | Issue | Kind | Responsible | Priority | Model | Reasoning effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

`run.json` and `planner-calls.json` of the run directories named under **Reproduce** hold the payload
the model sent; the directories are under `.temp/result/`. The root `logMessages` in `plan.xml`'s
`externalConfiguration` retain library calculation diagnostics that compact plan contexts omit.
