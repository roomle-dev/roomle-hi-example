# Bug Analyses

One document per bug analysis: a deep root-cause investigation written **before** the fix, closed out **after** it.

Triggered by **"analyse the bug"** / **"analyze the bug"** / **"bug analysis"** — see
**Analysis Triggers** in [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

## What belongs here

Point-in-time, investigation-driving write-ups. The document must cover:

- symptom and reproduction steps
- investigation trace with code references
- the exact root cause (file:line)
- why the current code produces wrong results
- the proposed clean fix

## What does not belong here

A symptom-level fix or workaround. All bug fixes must address the root cause, not hide the symptom.

## Close-out

When the bug is fixed, the durable outcome (the invariant, the rule, the corrected understanding)
is promoted into the appropriate living-reference document, and this document is closed out with:

- Status set to `Fixed`
- Pre-work sections rewritten into past tense
- Fix summary and validation results

Mechanics: Follow the pattern from RoomleCore's analysis close-out process.
Never delete an analysis document — it is the rationale for code that looks arbitrary without it.

## Current Documents

This folder is initially empty. Add bug analysis documents as needed following the naming convention:
`kebab-case-description.md` (e.g., `stale-group-position-after-move.md`).
